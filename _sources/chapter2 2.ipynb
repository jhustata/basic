    "\n",
    "This command is your gateway to reviewing the most recent test results stored by Stata. It lists out all the statistics calculated by the last command, including the number of observations (`r(N)`), test statistics like chi-squared values (`r(chi2)`), and crucially, the p-value (`r(p)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply listing out the p-value isn't always enough, especially when preparing your findings for a broader audience, such as in peer-reviewed publications. The reporting of p-values follows specific conventions to enhance clarity and understanding. Let's explore how to apply these conventions using a conditional formatting approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Introduction to the \"quietly\" Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The first block introduces the concept of running commands 'quietly' in Stata, which suppresses the output in the Results window.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    // Your Stata commands here\n",
    "} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `qui {`: This command is short for 'quietly'. It tells Stata to execute the commands within the braces without displaying the usual output in the Results window. It's helpful for keeping your results clean or when you're only interested in the final outcome rather than seeing every step.\n",
    "- `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the 'quietly' section. After this point, Stata will return to its default behavior, which is to display output for each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Handling p-values Less Than 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "The second block explains how to handle cases where p-values are less than 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    if r(p) < 0.01 {\n",
    "        local p: di \"p < 0.01\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `if r(p) < 0.01 {`: This line checks if the p-value (`r(p)`) from the last statistical test is less than 0.01. If true, the commands inside the braces will execute.\n",
    "- `local p: di \"p < 0.01\"`: Here, if the condition is met, we assign a formatted string \"p < 0.01\" to a local macro named `p`. This is a concise way to communicate that the test results are highly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Formatting p-values Between 0.01 and 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The third block focuses on p-values that fall between 0.01 and 0.05, using precision formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {\n",
    "        local p: di %3.2f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {`: This line checks if the p-value is within the specified range. The `inrange()` function is versatile, allowing for clear boundary definitions.\n",
    "- `local p: di %3.2f r(p)`: For p-values in this range, we format the number to have two decimal places (e.g., 0.03), ensuring clarity and precision in our reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Formatting p-values Greater Than 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth block deals with formatting p-values greater than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        local p: di %2.1f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else {`: This part catches any cases not previously covered, essentially p-values greater than 0.05.\n",
    "- `local p: di %2.1f r(p)`: Here, we format the p-value to have one decimal place, indicating a less strict interpretation of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Combining Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we combine all the parts into a cohesive whole, demonstrating how to format p-values based on their value, all within a 'quietly' block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "\n",
    "qui { //asks Stata to work \"quietly\", until the corresponding brace is closed at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "    capture log close\n",
    "    log using chi2.log, replace //creates a .log file\n",
    "    use transplants, clear //imports the datafile\n",
    "    tab dx gender, row  chi2 //performs a chi-square test\n",
    "\n",
    "    if r(p) < 0.01 {\n",
    "       local p: di \"p < 0.01\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {\n",
    "       local p: di %3.2f r(p)\n",

    "\tlog close //closes the .log file\n",
    "} //after this brace Stata may return to its default: \"noisely\" produce output as it runs the program\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This final block puts everything together, showing how to use `qui` to suppress unnecessary output while precisely formatting p-values according to their significance level. The following line then displays the formatted p-value, completing the explanation of how to communicate statistical results clearly and effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "noi di \"p = `p'\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recap of the chi-square test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we start by checking if the p-value is less than 0.01. If so, we report it as \"p < 0.01\" to indicate a very high level of statistical significance. This convention signals to the reader that the result is significant beyond the conventional thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value falls between 0.01 and 0.05, we report it in a standard numeric format (e.g., 0.03), maintaining two decimal places for precision. This range indicates statistical significance at the conventional 5% level, which is widely accepted in many research disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For p-values greater than 0.05, we format them with one decimal place, acknowledging that while the result may not meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance, it is still worth reporting for a comprehensive understanding of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to formatting and reporting p-values is not just about following academic conventions; it's about making your results clear and interpretable for your audience, facilitating better understanding and discussion of your research findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, here's how the output might look after applying our formatting script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    ". return list \n",
    "\n",
    "scalars:\n",
    "r(N) =  2000\n",

    "```\n",
    "**Note for Students:** This command is your starting point. It loads a dataset from a specified URL into Stata, clearing anything that was in memory before. Always ensure you're working with the correct dataset by loading it appropriately. This particular dataset, `transplants.dta`, is likely related to medical transplant records, given its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Listing Variables\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "ds\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note for Students:** The `ds` command is a quick way to list all variables in your dataset. It's a good practice to familiarize yourself with the variables available to you before starting any analysis. Knowing what data you have is the first step in understanding what questions you can answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output from `ds` Command:**\n",
    "```stata\n",
    ". ds\n",
    "fake_id       don_hgt_cm    don_ecd       rec_hgt_cm    prev_ki       end_date      wait_yrs      rec_hcv_an~y  rec_educat~n\n",

    "transplant~e  don_cod       race          bmi           peak_pra      tx_failed     gender        pretx_cmv\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note for Students:** This output lists the variables in your dataset. From `fake_id` to `pretx_cmv`, each variable represents a different attribute related to the transplants. For example, `don_hgt_cm` might stand for donor height in centimeters, and `rec_wgt_kg` could be the recipient's weight in kilograms. Understanding each variable's meaning is essential for any analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Help\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "help ds\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note for Students:** Whenever you're unsure about a command or need to know more about its options and syntax, use `help <command>`. It's a lifesaver and a fast way to access documentation directly within Stata.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering Variables by Type\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "ds, has(type)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note for Students:** This command uses the `has` option with the `ds` command to filter variables by a specific attribute, in this case, `type`. However, this example is incomplete because it doesn't specify what type to filter by. In practice, you would use something like `ds, has(type numeric)` to list only numeric variables. It's a powerful feature for when you need to narrow down your list of variables to those that meet specific criteria, such as numeric, string, or date variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Start with data**: Loading your data correctly is step one. Ensure the dataset you're using is the one you intend to analyze.\n",
    "- **Know your tools**: Use commands like `ds` to understand what variables you have at your disposal. This knowledge is crucial for planning your analysis.\n",
    "- **Learn continuously**: Use the `help` feature liberally to deepen your understanding of Stata's commands and their options.\n",
    "- **Be selective**: Learn to use commands in ways that filter and narrow down to the information you need, making your analysis more efficient and your code cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to experiment with these commands and options to get comfortable working with data in Stata. Practical exercises that require you to load, inspect, and manipulate datasets will reinforce these concepts and improve your proficiency in Stata programming. The labs focus on such activity."

    "   - **`creturn list`** shows scalar values like the number of observations or the R-squared value, which are returned by commands that concern the characteristics of the current dataset or model.\n",
    "   - **`ereturn list`** is used after estimation commands (like `regress`) to show estimation results such as coefficients and statistics.\n",
    "   - **`return list`** displays results from commands that do not fit into the estimation category, like tabulations or general statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's a good practice to use these commands to check and verify the output of your analysis, ensuring you understand the results and the model's behavior. However, for someone starting, this might feel like information overload. Remember, the value lies in understanding what each piece of output signifies about your data and model.\n",

It's a neat way to explore categorical data. This command makes sense as it explores the association between two categorical variables, potentially offering insights into patterns or disparities in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, **`return list`** again, after the `tab` command, will likely show different information relevant to the tabulation rather than the regression analysis. It's crucial to understand how the output context shifts based on the last command run."

    "## 2.5 Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Macros in Stata: A Guide for New Graduate Students\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stata, **macros** are a powerful feature that allows you to store both string and numeric values under simple names. This makes it easier to reference complex information throughout your code. Think of macros as shorthand or a nickname for data you frequently use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "Macros in Stata can be broadly categorized into two types: **System** and **User-defined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Macros**\n",
    "   - These are predefined by Stata and automatically store specific information from your analysis, making it easily accessible for later use.\n",
    "   - To view what's currently stored by Stata, use the following commands:\n",
    "     - `creturn list` displays system constants, like the current version of Stata.\n",
    "     - `return list` shows results from general commands.\n",
    "     - `ereturn list` is used for displaying results from estimation commands (regressions, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User-defined Macros**\n",
    "   - As the name suggests, these are defined by the user (that's you!) to store values for future reference. There are two kinds:\n",
    "     - **Global Macros**: These are accessible from anywhere in your current Stata session. They're perfect for values you need to use repeatedly across different parts of your analysis.\n",
    "       - Example: Setting a global macro for your working directory can streamline file paths.\n",
    "       ```stata\n",
    "       global workdir \"`c(pwd)'/\"\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - **Local Macros**: These are temporary and only accessible within the block of code or program where they were defined. Use them to store interim results or values that are only relevant in a specific context.\n",
    "       - Example: Storing the mean of a variable for quick reference in your code.\n",
    "       ```stata\n",
    "       local mean: di %3.1f r(mean)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repetitive Values**: Use macros for values or paths you find yourself typing out repeatedly. This can save time and reduce errors.\n",
    "- **Dynamic References**: When working with datasets that undergo multiple transformations, macros can help keep track of changing values without manually updating them each time.\n",
    "- **Code Clarity and Maintenance**: Macros make your code easier to read and maintain. Instead of hardcoding values that might change, use a macro. If the value needs to be updated, you only have to change the macro definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naming**: Choose clear and descriptive names for your macros. Remember, what makes sense to you now should ideally be understandable to someone else (or even you) when looking at the code months later.\n",
    "- **Scope Appropriately**: Use global macros sparingly and only for values that truly need to be global. When in doubt, default to local macros to prevent unexpected results.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Especially for global macros, document their purpose and usage at the point of definition. This is helpful in collaborative projects or any future review of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Macros are a fundamental part of efficient and effective Stata programming. By incorporating them into your workflow, you'll streamline your code, reduce the potential for errors, and make your entire analysis more manageable. As you become more comfortable with Stata, you'll find even more creative and powerful ways to use macros in your projects."

    "### Introduction to Stata Programs: Creating Your First Custom Program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Stata Program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Stata program** is essentially a user-defined command that allows you to encapsulate a sequence of Stata commands into a single, reusable command. This can greatly streamline your workflow, especially when you need to perform repetitive tasks or analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Simple Stata Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through creating your very first Stata program, `myfirstprogram`. This basic program will display a greeting message to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Program Definition**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Begin by telling Stata that you're defining a new program using the `program define` command. This is followed by the name of your program. Here, our program is named `myfirstprogram`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   program define myfirstprogram\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing the Program's Commands**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Inside the program, you can include any Stata commands you wish to execute when the program is called. In this case, we'll use the `di` (display) command to show a simple greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   di \"Hello, Class!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ending the Program Definition**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Conclude the definition of your program with the `end` command. This lets Stata know that you've finished writing your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   end\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete Program Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, the complete code for `myfirstprogram` looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "program define myfirstprogram\n",
    "   di \"Hello, Class!\"\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Your Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Once defined, you can run your program by simply typing its name into the Stata command window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "myfirstprogram\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon execution, you'll see the message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Class!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "displayed in the Stata Results window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Custom Programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Save time by combining frequently used command sequences into a single command.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Share your custom programs with classmates or colleagues to promote consistent methodologies.\n",
    "- **Organization**: Keep your Stata do-files cleaner and more organized by encapsulating complex procedures within programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naming**: Choose clear, descriptive names for your programs to easily remember their purpose.\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable programs when possible. This enhances readability and debuggability.\n",
    "- **Comments**: Use comments within your programs to explain the purpose of each section or command. This is invaluable for future reference and for others using your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating custom programs in Stata can significantly enhance your data analysis efficiency and effectiveness. Starting with simple programs like `myfirstprogram`, you can gradually build up to more complex and powerful tools tailored to your specific needs."
