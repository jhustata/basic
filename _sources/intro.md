Welcome to [340.600](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/course/38901) Stata Programming I (Basic)  

If you have any questions about [340.700](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/course/38901) Stata Programming II (Intermediate), don't hesitate to seek clarification from your [Analytic Mentors](https://jhustata.github.io/basic/quickrefs.html). And if you wonder there's a course offering for Stata Programming III (Advanced), unfortanetly there'll be offering this years. However, content of relevance to advanced Stata Programming can be found [here](https://jhufena.github.io/home/intro.html).  

The `Basic` class will be offered in a hybrid-format to cater to both those who will be in-person at the Bloomberg School Wolfe **W1214** (Sheldon Hall) and those who will be joining us virtually (Zoom [link](https://jhjhm.zoom.us/j/98481767907)). In-person attendees are encouraged to also log into zoom, which allows students to share code and to collectively `debug`. Students last year described this as one of the best aspects of their learning experience. 

By contrast, exclusively in-person class formats without the zoom option make it difficult for students to articulate the issues they might be confronting. This makes collective troubleshooting a nightmare. 

Our class will be structured as follows:
   
   + Class: Thursday, 3:30-5:20pm lecture
   + Labs: M T W Th F
   + HW: Weeks [1, 2, 3], [4, 5], and [6, 7]     
     
Evaluation of your progress will be done on a weekly basis:

   + One graded homework per week (for more frequent feedback compared with previous years)
      - Content for Weeks 1, 2, 3 = HW 1 in previous years
      - Content for Weeks 4, 5 = HW 2 in previous years
      - Content for Weeks 6, 7 = HW 3 in previous years
   + An optional assignment given at the end of the class 
   + We encourage you to do each each weeks lab before submitting your homework
   + Everyone who turns in every homework on time will get an A or a B

Please use the [CoursePlus](https://courseplus.jhu.edu/core/index.cfm/go/course.home/coid/21040/) Discussion Forum to ask general questions about Stata, course administration, etc. You may email your instructor if you have confidential questions (e.g. grades). 

Zoom protocol will be simple. Everyone but the lecturer will be muted. You are welcome to type questions into the zoom chat window, which we will check every few minutes. **During labs** please post questions and comments to the CoursePlus message board for fellow students to reference. We intend to record and post lectures; but there can be no guarantees. Please watch live if feasible.

A few words on academic integrity. Copying small code snippets from books, the Internet, or classmates is permissible and even encouraged as long as it is accompanied with citation in the comments that may look something like this:

```stata

```

Use of AI including chatGPT as a copilot, guide, or assistant is <u>strongly</u> encouraged during- and long after completion of this course[.](labs.md)
