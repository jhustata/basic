    "<div class=\"content\">\n",
    "    <p>1. **Introduction Enhancement**: Start with a concise, inviting introduction that encapsulates the essence of the course and what students can expect. This will set the tone and engage the reader right away.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>2. **Streamline Information**: While detailed information is valuable, too much detail can overwhelm. Consider summarizing where possible and linking to detailed instructions or information stored elsewhere. This can make the quick reference guide more accessible and less daunting, especially for new students.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>3. **Visual Elements**: Introduce visual elements like icons or small graphics next to each section title. For instance, a small video icon next to \"Zoom Online Classroom\", a book for \"Course Materials and Communications\", etc. Visuals can make the page more engaging and help students quickly identify sections.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>4. **Interactive Elements**: If technically feasible, incorporate collapsible sections or tabs for each main category. This allows the page to appear less cluttered and lets users expand the sections most relevant to their immediate needs.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>5. **Update and Highlight Important Changes**: If there are any updates or important notices since the last course iteration, consider adding a \"What's New\" section at the top or highlight these changes within the relevant sections. This helps returning students quickly grasp any modifications.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>6. **Accessibility and Navigation**: Ensure that all links are working and accessible. Consider adding a back-to-top button or sticky menu that allows users to easily navigate between sections without having to scroll excessively.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>7. **Feedback Section**: Add a section inviting suggestions on the quick reference guide itself. This can help you gather insights into what students find most useful or where they may need additional clarity, allowing for continuous improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>8. **Contact Information Visibility**: While you've included detailed contact information, consider summarizing it at the top or in a sidebar for quick access, ensuring students can easily find how to reach out with questions or for support.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>9. **FAQs or Troubleshooting Guide**: If common issues or questions arise concerning course logistics or technical platforms used (like Zoom or GitHub), a brief FAQ or troubleshooting guide could preemptively address these, reducing repetitive inquiries.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <p>10. **Personal Touch**: End with a short motivational note or welcome message from the instructor, adding a personal touch that can make students feel more connected and engaged right from the start.</p>\n",
