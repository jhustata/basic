    "Before diving into nested data, let's visit the concept of [debugging](https://jhustata.github.io/basic/lab5.html#settings) with a simple example from Lab 5 last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no perfect time to introduce this topic, but many of you have likely experienced the frustration of encountering an error when running a script—whether it's your own or one shared with you—and not being able to pinpoint the issue.\n",

    "   <Summary>Hardcoding</Summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly [revisit Week 5](https://jhustata.github.io/basic/chapter5.html): Review of Weeks 1 - 4\n",
    "\n",
    "View the script we used to guide our review:\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "cat https://github.com/jhustata/basic/raw/main/review.do\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script to see its output:\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "cat https://github.com/jhustata/basic/raw/main/review.do\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script creates output into a `.log` file. But HW5 asks you to additionally direct output into a `.xlsx` file. How may we adapt the script to this purpose? Yes, this is the key question of HW5. Many of you may have missed a tip for [HW3](https://jhustata.github.io/basic/chapter3.html#common-mistakes-from-hw1) that recommended \"hardcoding\" as a template -- a starting place. You may then gradually replace the hardcoded stuff with appropriate macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardcoding as a firststep. In this example:\n",
    "1. We use the `ds` command, `not(type string)` option, and `levelsof`. These were only briefly mentioned in class, but were further discussed in [Lab 5 Section 2.2](https://jhustata.github.io/basic/lab5.html#foreach-n-of-numlist)\n",
    "2. Nested loops and conditional code-blocks (e.g. `if r(r) == 2`) can be very empowering!\n",
    "3. Gradually **update** your `.do` file script to replace hardcoded stuff (e.g. `catlab`), or stuff that isn't publication worthy (e.g. `v`, which in this example is a variable name) with more appropriate macros or variable labels\n",
    "4. The HW5 solution will walk you through such a process\n",
    "5. Copy and paste your `.do` file script into a program. And adapt it to a more general purpose, beyond any specific dataset or variables\n",
